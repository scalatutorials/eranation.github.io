  def add1(x:Int, y:Int) = x + y //method  
  val add2 = (x:Int, y:Int) => x + y //anonymous function  
  val add3:(Int,Int)=>Int = _ + _ //alternate way  
  val add4 = (_ + _):(Int,Int)=>Int //alternate way, rare   
      
  println(add0(42,13))

  println(add3(42,13))

- The first example is a method definition as we've seen before
- The second, is like the previous slide, only assigned to a val, this is very, very roughly like the difference between 

  ````javascript
  function foo(x, y) { 
      return x + y; 
  }
  ```

  and 

  ```javascript
  var foo = function(x, y) { 
      return x + y; 
  }
  ```
  in JavaScript.
- The third, was briefly demonstrated in the previous slide, uses the shorter `_` placeholder syntax. However the usage on the left is rare in Scala, the `_` notation for anonymous functions is mostly useful when passing them as parameter to higher order functions (functions that recieve or return other functions)
